### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Single Binary**: `go:embed web/dist` bundles the entire Vue SPA into the Go binary. No separate web server needed.
2. **Zero ORM**: Raw SQL via `pgx/v5` for maximum performance and control over complex ERP queries.
3. **JWT RS256**: Stateless authentication with access token (24h) + refresh token (30d).
4. **Transactional Integrity**: Critical operations (invoice confirm, payroll, stock movements) run in single PostgreSQL transactions.
5. **Algerian Compliance**: IRG brackets, CNAS rates, SCF chart of accounts, G50/G29 declarations built-in.

Based on the features of Mab ERP from the provided GitHub repository and other major global ERP solutions, here is a detailed comparison table in English.

### Mab ERP vs. Global ERP Systems: A Feature Comparison

This table compares **Mab ERP** (based on its v1.1.0 release) against five leading global ERP solutions: **SAP S/4HANA** , **Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP** , **Microsoft Dynamics 365** , **Odoo** , and **ERPNext** .

| Feature / Aspect | **Mab ERP** | **SAP S/4HANA** | **Oracle Cloud ERP** | **Microsoft Dynamics 365** | **Odoo** | **ERPNext** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Market & Philosophy** | Algerian businesses seeking a cost-effective, compliant, and easy-to-deploy solution. | Large enterprises needing a comprehensive, integrated, and highly customizable global platform . | Large enterprises focused on cloud-based, AI-driven financial management and a unified data model . | Mid-sized to large organizations looking for a scalable, AI-enhanced suite deeply integrated with Microsoft tools . | Small to medium-sized businesses wanting a modern, modular, and cost-effective open-source solution . | Small to large businesses seeking an affordable, open-source, and highly flexible all-in-one system . |
| **Deployment & Architecture** | **Single Binary** (Go + Vue 3) – Extremely simple. Requires only PostgreSQL. | Complex, multi-tier on-premise or cloud. Requires significant infrastructure and expertise . | Cloud-native (SaaS) or on-premise. Requires substantial infrastructure and specialized knowledge . | Cloud (SaaS) or on-premise. Leverages Azure. Integrates deeply with Microsoft ecosystem . | On-premise, Cloud (SaaS), or custom. Modular architecture built with Python/JavaScript . | On-premise or Cloud (SaaS). Built on the Frappe framework (Python/JS) . |
| **Pricing Model** | **Self-Hosted (Free)** – Open source. Cost primarily for internal IT/PostgreSQL hosting. | **Proprietary & Expensive** – High licensing, implementation, and maintenance costs . | **Proprietary & High-Cost** – Subscription-based, significant investment for enterprise-scale features and support. | **Proprietary (SaaS Subscriptions)** – Per-user/per-month; costs vary significantly by module . | **Open Source (Free)** – Community version free. Enterprise version has paid subscriptions for support and hosting. | **Open Source (Free)** – Self-hosted is free. Paid support and cloud hosting available. |
| **Algerian Compliance** | **Native & Built-in** – Pre-loaded SCF Chart of Accounts, IRG tax brackets, CNAS rates, G50/G29 declaration generation. | **Requires Localization** – Heavy customization, partner implementation, and add-ons needed for local legal and fiscal requirements. | **Requires Localization** – Requires significant customization and local partner expertise for Algerian regulations. | **Requires Localization** – Needs configuration or partner-developed extensions for Algerian law. | **Requires Localization** – Requires community-developed or custom-coded modules for Algerian rules. | **Requires Localization** – Requires custom development to adapt to Algerian SCF, IRG, and CNAS. |
| **Key Modules & Breadth** | 14 core modules (Accounting, HR/Payroll, Sales, Purchase, Inventory, Manufacturing, Projects, Treasury, Tax, Workflow, etc.). | Full Suite (Finance, HR, SCM, Manufacturing, Sales, etc.) but highly modular and customizable . | Full Suite (Financials, Project Management, Procurement, Risk Management, etc.) . | Full Suite (Sales, Customer Service, Finance, Supply Chain, HR, Field Service, etc.) . | **Extensive (70+)** – Extremely broad, with apps for everything from eCommerce to POS to Manufacturing . | Comprehensive (Accounting, HR, Inventory, Sales, Purchase, Projects, etc.) . |
| **Ease of Use / UI** | Modern, Single-Page Application built with Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS (Standard modern UI). | Generally considered complex, requiring significant training; older UI being modernized in S/4HANA. | Modern, cloud-native user experience. | Modern, intuitive interface consistent with Windows and other Microsoft products . | Modern, clean, and highly user-friendly interface, known for good usability . | **Functional but Outdated** – Often noted as having an older, less modern interface . |
| **Technical Architecture** | Cutting-edge: **Golang + Vue 3**. Single binary deployment with embedded frontend. Zero ORM for performance. | Proprietary ABAP/Java; complex. S/4HANA optimized for SAP's HANA in-memory database . | Proprietary Java/Cloud; designed for cloud-native, AI-driven processes . | Microsoft Azure; primarily uses .NET and integrates with Azure AI and Power Platform . | Python/JavaScript on the Odoo framework. Highly modular and customizable . | Python/JavaScript on the Frappe framework, which provides a modern backend and a Vue-based UI . |
| **Pros** | **Algerian-specific compliance**, extremely simple deployment, modern tech stack, cost-effective, good feature coverage for core ERP. | Unmatched global enterprise scale, deep process integration, industry best practices built-in. | Strong AI/ML capabilities, native cloud platform, real-time data accessibility, integrated SaaS. | Seamless integration with Microsoft ecosystem (Outlook, Excel), strong AI (Copilot), and powerful BI tools . | Highly modular, extensive app ecosystem, user-friendly, democratizes access to ERP for SMBs . | Very cost-effective, open-source, highly customizable, comprehensive core features . |
| **Cons** | **New system** with limited global market presence. Lacks niche or industry-specific modules (e.g., Fleet, Quality) mentioned in the release notes. | High cost, long and complex implementation cycles, requires specialized consultants, less flexible . | High cost, complex to implement, can be overkill for smaller businesses. | Can become expensive with multiple modules; implementation often requires a partner for complex scenarios. | Complexity can grow significantly with many modules; enterprise-grade customization may require partner support. | Initial setup and deep customization require **technical knowledge**; interface can feel dated . |

### Summary

- **Mab ERP** is a highly specialized, modern, and cost-effective solution that is **uniquely positioned for the Algerian market**. Its key strength is its **native compliance** with local legal and fiscal requirements (SCF, IRG, CNAS, G50/G29)  combined with a **simple, modern, and powerful** technical architecture (single binary, Go+Vue).
- **SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft** are "global giants" designed for large enterprises. They offer immense depth and scale but come with very high costs and complexity. They are not tailored for Algeria out-of-the-box and would require expensive customizations .
- **Odoo and ERPNext** are direct open-source competitors. They offer a similar cost benefit and modularity. However, Mab ERP is arguably more modern in its architecture (single binary vs. traditional application stacks) and has a specific, built-in focus on the **Algerian market** that Odoo and ERPNext lack without significant custom development .

In conclusion, **Mab ERP competes by offering a "best of both worlds" proposition**: the affordability and openness of solutions like Odoo, with a state-of-the-art, simple-to-deploy architecture and immediate, out-of-the-box compliance for **Algerian businesses** .
